Mild coronary artery atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are also seen. No acute abnormality in the branch vessels of the superior mediastinum and lower neck. The main pulmonary artery is upper limits of normal in size. No large central pulmonary embolism identified. The heart 18 normal in size. No pericardial effusion. The mediastinal esophagus and thyroid gland are unremarkable. Mildly enlarged distal right paratracheal lymph node measuring 13 mm in short axis dimension not Significantly changed from the previous exam. No hilar lymphadenopathy identified. Lungs/pleura: The central airways are patent. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An azygous fissure is seen. Mild emphysematous changes. mm nodule in the left lower lobe on image 89 series 4 new from mm nodule in the left lower lobe on image 88 also new. 4 mm nodule in the right lung apex on image 38 without significant change There is new irregular consolidative opacity in the right lung apex with areas of central cavitation. This measures approximately 4.5 2.2 cm on image 3/7 series 4. There are also mild scattered patchy ground-glass opacities most pronounced in the bilateral upper lobes. Soft Tissues/Bones: No axillary lymphadenopathy. mildly sclerotic lesion in the left posterior T1O superior endplate unchanged from at least Other suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion. No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality. Abdomen/Pelvis: Page 2 of 4 Page 3 Organs: Multiple somewhat ill-defined low-density lesions in the liver that are partially calcified. The largest is in the right hepatic lobe measuring approximately 11.3 9.8 cm on axial image 41 grossly unchanged from new hepatic lesion identified. The gallbladder is unremarkable. No biliary ductal dilatation. The pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. Mild splenomegaly without significant change. 14 mm cystic lesion in the right kidney measuring mildly hyperdense to water unchanged to represent benign cyst. The left kidney is unremarkable. No obstructive uropathy. GI/Bowel: The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. Oral contrast reaches the splenic flexure of the colon. No obstruction or definite wall thickening identified. Pelvis: The urinary bladder is normal in appearance. The prostate gland is unremarkable. Large volume of free fluid in the pelvis. Fluid extends into the bilateral inguinal canals. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Peritoneum/Retroperitoneum: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with mild atherosclerosis. volume of ascites. No pneumoperitoneum. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Tissues: Small periumbilical hernia containing fat and fluid. No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion. No acute osseous or soft tissue abnormality. 1. 4.5 2.2 cm irregular partially cavitary consolidative lesion in the right lung apex new from This may represent post infectious scarring although neoplastic disease is not excluded. There are also new patchy mild bilateral ground-glass opacities suspicious for an atypical infectious process. 2. 6 mm and 4 mm nodules in the left lower lobe new from I. may be infectious although neoplastic disease is not excluded. 3. Unchanged partially calcified hepatic metastatic lesions compared with No other evidence of neoplastic disease in the abdomen or pelvis. 4. Large volume of ascites. 5.
